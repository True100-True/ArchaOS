This is x86_64 architecture code, from cpu to scheduler API init
This is ment to open API and allow kernel to flawlessly execute tasks that would be very 
different on each architecture, kinda like a mask.

This allows a massive flexibility in porting on CPU's 
allows x86_64, i386, RISC and alll cpus if done correctly
as of a design of course
