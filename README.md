# ArchaOS
A pure hobby, made with UEFI bootloader. Can run on real hardware but I dont recommend it.
Its free to use for any purpuse under MIT license. Its a really new project give it a few months.
Its inspired by TempleOS and Linux, made for community. I plan for it to be a reminder that everybody
can do anything. Especialy those who are at theyre deepest.
